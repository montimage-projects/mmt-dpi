/*
 * tcp_doff_min_test — crafted-input regression test for the TCP data-offset
 * (doff) minimum-length validation.
 *
 * Part of the MMT-DPI Master Improvement Plan, Phase 7 (issue #25, M6).
 *
 * The TCP data offset (`doff`) is a 4-bit header field that, per RFC 793, must
 * be at least 5 — a 20-byte header with no options. Before the fix,
 * tcp_pre_classification_function() (and its reassembling twin) in
 * src/mmt_tcpip/lib/protocols/proto_tcp.c derived the header length straight
 * from doff:
 *
 *     uint16_t tcphdr_len = packet->tcp->doff * 4;
 *     if (packet->l4_packet_len < tcphdr_len) return 0;   // length sanity
 *     packet->payload = ((uint8_t *) packet->tcp) + tcphdr_len;
 *
 * A malformed doff of 0 produces tcphdr_len == 0, which slips past the
 * "l4_packet_len < tcphdr_len" check and leaves the parser treating the whole
 * segment (including the bytes that are actually part of the TCP header) as
 * payload. The fix rejects any segment whose doff is below 5 before deriving
 * offsets from it.
 *
 * This test drives tcp_pre_classification_function() directly with crafted TCP
 * headers. The function sets packet->payload only once it has accepted the
 * doff value and passed the subsequent length check, so packet->payload is a
 * clean observable for the gate:
 *
 *   - doff in 0..4 (malformed): rejected at the doff gate -> packet->payload
 *     stays NULL (the early return runs before the payload assignment).
 *   - doff in 5..15 (valid):    accepted past the doff gate -> packet->payload
 *     is set to (tcp header start + doff*4), i.e. non-NULL.
 *
 * The packet data buffer is heap-allocated and exactly sized so AddressSanitizer
 * brackets it tightly; the runner (run_tcp_doff_min_test.sh) builds the library
 * and this test with -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all, so
 * any out-of-bounds access while parsing a malformed header aborts. A clean
 * exit 0 with every assertion passing is the success condition.

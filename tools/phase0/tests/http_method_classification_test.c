/*
 * http_method_classification_test — regression test for the HTTP method
 * table gap and the hot-path stdout prints (issue #101, finding ACC-16).
 *
 * Part of the MMT-DPI Master Improvement Plan performance/accuracy pass.
 *
 * Before this fix, `get_request_method_uri_offset()` (http.c) — the
 * hand-maintained switch that turns the first bytes of an HTTP request line
 * into a method code for the `http.method` attribute — recognized only
 * GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS/HEAD/CONNECT/PROPFIND/REPORT. PATCH, MKCOL, and
 * LOCK fell through and returned a zero offset, i.e. "not a request line".
 *
 * The sibling classification-path function `http_request_url_offset()`
 * (also in http.c) has the identical bug: an unrecognized first method makes
 * it return 0, and its only caller then permanently excludes the whole flow
 * from PROTO_HTTP via `http_bitmask_exclude()` — so a flow whose first
 * request used PATCH/MKCOL/LOCK falls to UNKNOWN for its entire lifetime on
 * non-80 ports. Both functions were fixed together (identical new cases,
 * same method strings); `http_request_url_offset()` cannot be exercised
 * directly from this test binary because it is `static` in http.c AND a
 * second, unrelated, already non-static function of the exact same name
 * lives in proto_http.c (used by the separate http_parser-integration code
 * path) — declaring it `extern` here would collide with that symbol at link
 * time. `get_request_method_uri_offset()` has no such collision (grep
 * confirms it is only ever defined/used in http.c), so it was made
 * non-static (matching the existing http2.c extraction-function convention)
 * specifically so this regression test can drive it directly. It exercises
 * the exact same table-gap bug pattern the issue describes.
 *
 * The library must be built with BUILD=asan; the runner
 * (run_http_method_classification_test.sh) takes care of that.

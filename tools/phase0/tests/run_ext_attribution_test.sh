# run_ext_attribution_test.sh — build the externally-updatable IP-range / port
# attribution loader unit test against an ASan/UBSan-instrumented build of the
# SDK and run it (issue #26, M9).
#
# Steps:
#   1. Build + install the SDK with BUILD=asan into an isolated prefix.
#   2. Compile tools/phase0/tests/ext_attribution_test.c against that library,
#      itself instrumented with -fsanitize=address,undefined. The loaders under
#      test (mmt_tcpip_load_ip_ranges_file / mmt_tcpip_load_port_map_file) and
#      the AVL lookup (_find_proto_id_by_address) are exported from libmmt_tcpip
#      but not part of any installed public header, so the test re-declares them
#      and links libmmt_tcpip directly.
#   3. Run it. With -fno-sanitize-recover=all any sanitizer hit aborts; all
#      assertions must also pass. Exit 0 == clean.
#
# Usage: tools/phase0/tests/run_ext_attribution_test.sh

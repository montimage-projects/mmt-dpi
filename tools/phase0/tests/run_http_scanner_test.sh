# run_http_scanner_test.sh — build the bounded HTTP scanner / ctype hardening
# test against an ASan/UBSan-instrumented build of the SDK and run it
# (issue #7, H4 + H5).
#
# Steps:
#   1. Build + install the SDK with BUILD=asan into an isolated prefix.
#   2. Compile tools/phase0/tests/http_scanner_test.c against that library,
#      itself instrumented with -fsanitize=address,undefined. The internal
#      packet struct header is pulled from the source tree (it is not part of
#      the installed public include set).
#   3. Run it. With -fno-sanitize-recover=all, any out-of-bounds read or
#      undefined ctype call aborts with non-zero status; all assertions must
#      also pass. Exit 0 == clean.
#
# Usage: tools/phase0/tests/run_http_scanner_test.sh

# run_ip_unaligned_header_test.sh — build the issue #57 regression test against
# an ASan/UBSan-instrumented build of the SDK and run it.
#
# Issue #57: the IP/L4 classification path cast "&ipacket->data[offset]" (a
# byte-aligned capture buffer) to struct iphdr/tcphdr/udphdr and dereferenced
# multi-byte fields directly. When a header does not land on its natural
# boundary that is a misaligned access — UB that aborts under
# -fsanitize=alignment. The SDK copies each packet into a 16-byte-aligned
# buffer, so a 14-byte Ethernet header puts the IPv4 header at a 2-byte-aligned
# (not 4-byte-aligned) address, making the bug deterministic.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Build + install the SDK with BUILD=asan into an isolated prefix.
#   2. Compile tools/phase0/tests/ip_unaligned_header_test.c against it,
#      itself instrumented with -fsanitize=address,undefined.
#   3. Run it. The library loads its protocol plugins from the compiled-in
#      prefix ($PREFIX/plugins). With -fno-sanitize-recover=all any misaligned
#      access aborts with non-zero status; all assertions must also pass.
#      Exit 0 == clean.
#
# Usage: tools/phase0/tests/run_ip_unaligned_header_test.sh

# run_mt_tsan_test.sh — build the multi-threaded thread-safety harness against a
# ThreadSanitizer-instrumented build of the SDK and run it (issue #65).
#
# This mechanically verifies the Phase 6 thread-safety work that was previously
# "verified by construction" only:
#   - #22  global registry mutexes (packet_processing.c / plugins_engine.c)
#   - #23  per-session RADIUS parser state (proto_radius.c)
#
# TSan only finds races in code built with -fsanitize=thread, and the race-prone
# code lives INSIDE the SDK libraries. So, mirroring run_redis_resp_test.sh, we:
#   1. Build + install the SDK with BUILD=tsan into an isolated prefix. The
#      install step also copies the freshly built (TSan) libmmt_tcpip.so into the
#      prefix's plugins dir, so the dlopen'd protocol plugin is TSan-instrumented
#      too (the core was compiled to look there via PLUGINS_REPOSITORY_OPT).
#   2. Synthesize a multi-flow RADIUS pcap (pure stdlib generator).
#   3. Compile tools/phase0/tests/mt_tsan_harness.c with -fsanitize=thread and
#      link it against the installed TSan libraries.
#   4. Run the harness under TSan in both replay and registry-stress modes over
#      the RADIUS pcap and an existing TCP pcap. With -fno-sanitize-recover=all a
#      data race aborts the process; fingerprint mismatches exit non-zero too.
#
# Usage: tools/phase0/tests/run_mt_tsan_test.sh

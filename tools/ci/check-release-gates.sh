# check-release-gates.sh — exact-release-SHA prerequisite evidence
# (issue #371, F-CI-001 — plan task 0.2).
#
# Publishing used to depend only on jobs inside the release run itself
# (build matrix, reproducibility, verify-tag): nothing proved the unit,
# sanitizer and golden-classification gates had passed AT the tagged
# commit — a tag could ship a commit whose CI failed, was cancelled, was
# skipped or never ran. This gate closes that hole: before the release
# job runs it requires, for the candidate SHA itself,
#
#   same-run evidence (needs context of the release-gates job):
#     - build            — the distro/arch package matrix, including the
#                          installed-consumer check (issue #374)
#     - reproducibility  — the double-build byte-identity guard (issue #220)
#     - verify-tag       — the tag == declared VERSION guard (issue #220)
#
#   commit evidence (check runs recorded on the candidate SHA by earlier
#   workflow runs — the tag push re-runs c-cpp.yml but those legs are
#   still in flight when this gate executes, so the decisive evidence is
#   the latest COMPLETED run of each required check):
#     - unit-tests                — every matrix leg (name or `name (...)`)
#     - sanitizer-tests           — every matrix leg (ASan + TSan suites)
#     - ASan/UBSan profile compiles — the phase0 SDK sanitizer gate
#     - Golden classification fingerprint unchanged (or its job id
#       `classification-gate` if the display name is ever dropped)
#
# Verdict rules (all fail-closed):
#   - a required check with NO matching check run at the SHA -> not eligible
#   - a check run whose head_sha differs from the candidate -> not eligible
#   - a check name whose latest completed run is not `success`
#     (failure/cancelled/skipped/neutral/timed_out/...) -> not eligible
#   - a check name seen only queued/in_progress -> not eligible
#   - several completed runs of one name: the newest wins, so a green
#     re-run repairs an older failure (and a newer failure voids a pass)
#   - any same-run needs result other than `success` -> not eligible
#
# Usage:
#   check-release-gates.sh [options] <candidate-sha>
#
#   --check-runs FILE   evaluate check-run JSON from FILE instead of the
#                       GitHub API (offline/self-test mode). Accepts the
#                       API shape {"check_runs": [...]}, a bare [...], or
#                       one check-run object per line (NDJSON).
#   --evidence FILE     write the recorded evidence as JSON to FILE
#   --skip-same-run     do not require the NEEDS_RESULT_* env evidence
#                       (local pre-flight of a not-yet-tagged commit)
#
# Env:
#   NEEDS_RESULT_BUILD / NEEDS_RESULT_REPRODUCIBILITY / NEEDS_RESULT_VERIFY_TAG
#                       result (success|failure|cancelled|skipped) of the
#                       same-run prerequisite job — required unless
#                       --skip-same-run is given
#   GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN   token for the check-runs API (live mode)
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY       owner/repo slug (live mode; default: the
#                           `origin` remote)
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY     when set, the evidence table is also appended
#                           to the job summary
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every required check is green at the candidate SHA,
# 1 = publication not eligible, 2 = helper broken (bad args, missing
# tools, unreadable/malformed evidence).

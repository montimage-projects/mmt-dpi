# run-cppcheck.sh — cppcheck static-analysis gate for src/ (issue #189, F-CI-004).
#
# The lint job used to run cppcheck with its exit status discarded: findings
# were counted and uploaded, but nothing gated on them, so error-severity
# findings shipped green and the total had no ceiling. This script is the gate
# the report-only step used to lack; it applies two independent checks:
#
#   1. Ratchet — a full `--enable=warning` scan writes the XML report the job
#      uploads, and the total finding count must not exceed the committed
#      baseline in tools/ci/cppcheck-ratchet.txt. A rise fails the step; a drop
#      is reported so the baseline can be tightened in the same change.
#   2. Error gate — a second pass restricted to error severity (cppcheck's
#      default check scope — the checks that produce error-severity findings
#      are always enabled; --enable=warning adds the rest) with
#      --error-exitcode=1, so any error-severity finding fails the step.
#
# Writes the pass-1 findings to cppcheck-report.xml at the repo root (override
# with $CPPCHECK_REPORT) — the same artifact the lint job publishes.
#
# Pinned cppcheck version (issue #345): the ratchet baseline is only
# meaningful for the cppcheck release it was measured with — a different
# release adds or drops checks, so the total drifts on unchanged code (e.g.
# 2.21 reports 35 findings where the baseline of 24 was measured with 2.13).
# CPPCHECK_PINNED_VERSION below is the major.minor the lint job gets from the
# ubuntu-24.04 cppcheck package (.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml, `lint` job).
# The script compares `cppcheck --version` with it:
#   - match      -> both gates are enforced;
#   - mismatch in CI (CI=true) -> exit 2: the runner image changed; re-measure
#     tools/ci/cppcheck-ratchet.txt with the new release and bump the pin in
#     the same change;
#   - mismatch locally -> warning; the ratchet verdict is advisory only (the
#     count is not comparable) while the error-severity gate stays enforced.
# For a verdict that matches CI, run cppcheck $CPPCHECK_PINNED_VERSION.x
# locally (e.g. in an ubuntu:24.04 container: apt-get install -y cppcheck).
# Never raise the baseline to absorb version drift.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = both gates pass, 1 = a gate tripped, 2 = the helper itself
# is broken (cppcheck missing or at an unexpected version in CI, unreadable
# baseline, unparseable report).
#
# Usage: bash tools/ci/run-cppcheck.sh

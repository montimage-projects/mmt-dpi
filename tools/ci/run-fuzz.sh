# run-fuzz.sh — bounded mutation-fuzz gate for the CI fuzz job (issue #224,
# F-SEC-009).
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds + installs the SDK with BUILD=asan and ENABLESEC=1 into an
#      isolated prefix — ASan/UBSan is the crash oracle; ENABLESEC also
#      produces libmmt_fuzz, the shipped fuzz engine that was previously
#      only compiled, never run.
#   2. Compiles two drivers against the prefix:
#      - tools/phase0/phase0_classify.c  (packet-classification surface:
#        pcap -> packet_process, the library's hostile-input entry point)
#      - tools/ci/fuzz/qe_xml_driver.c   (fuzz-engine surface: file ->
#        application_quality_estimation_xml_parser, so the fuzz run
#        exercises libmmt_fuzz rather than only linking it)
#   3. Until the wall-clock budget runs out, generates one deterministic
#      mutant per iteration — tools/ci/fuzz/mutate.py — seeded from the
#      vendored golden captures (tools/phase0/ci/pcaps/*.pcap) and the QE
#      model seed (tools/ci/fuzz/seed_qe.xml), and runs the matching driver
#      on it under a per-input timeout.
#
# Finding rule: an exit code >= 128 (signal — ASan/UBSan aborts with
# abort_on_error=1 and -fno-sanitize-recover=all, plus genuine SIGSEGV /
# SIGABRT) or 124 (per-input timeout — a hang on hostile input is a
# robustness finding) is a crash. So is a sanitizer report on the driver's
# stderr at any lower exit code: a sanitizer runtime that did not abort the
# process (UBSan without abort_on_error, ASan with halt_on_error=0 or a
# non-fatal report) prints its "runtime error" / "*Sanitizer" banner and
# still exits 0/1/2, which the exit code alone would silently pass (issue
# #370, F-TEST-001). Ordinary refusals (rc 1/2 — libpcap or libxml2 cleanly
# rejecting the mutant) carry no sanitizer banner, are not findings and are
# counted separately so a refusal never reads as a crash. An exit code of
# 126/127 means the driver itself could not be executed — harness breakage,
# never a finding. On a finding the
# reproducer file and the driver's stderr are copied into the artifacts
# directory and the run continues so one CI failure can carry several
# distinct reproducers (capped); the script exits 1 at the end when any
# finding was recorded. Exit 2 is reserved for the harness itself breaking
# (build/compile failure, missing corpus, unexecutable driver) so a broken
# gate can never read as a clean fuzz run.
#
# Suppressions: tools/ci/fuzz/suppressions.txt lists already-reported
# deterministic mutants as "<seed-file-basename>:<seed>" pairs, one per
# line, each carrying a trailing comment naming the tracking issue. A
# suppressed mutant is skipped at generation time — the gate stays strict
# for every input NOT on the list, and the list only ever grows a line when
# a finding has a filed issue to point at. The mechanism exists because the
# deterministic PR seed makes the same latent bugs fire on every pull
# request; suppressions keep a pre-existing bug tracked-and-visible without
# making CI permanently red.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/ci/run-fuzz.sh [--seconds N] [--seed N] [--artifacts DIR]
#                             [--iterations N] [--prefix DIR]
#
#   --seconds N      fuzzing wall-clock budget AFTER the build (default 300)
#   --seed N         base seed for mutate.py (default 224 — deterministic)
#   --iterations N   stop after N loop iterations even if budget remains
#                    (default 0 = wall-clock only). The PR job passes a cap so
#                    the explored mutant set is identical on every runner —
#                    without it a faster machine would reach uncharacterized
#                    mutants and could flake on an unreported hang.
#   --artifacts D    reproducer output dir (default ./fuzz-artifacts)
#   --prefix D       reuse an existing BUILD=asan+ENABLESEC install prefix
#                    instead of building (local iteration helper)
#
# Used by .github/workflows/c-cpp.yml (fuzz job). Runnable locally too.
